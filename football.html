          <h3>Why LeVeon Made the Right Choice</h3>
            <p>Imagine the discipline it must take to walk away from 15 million dollars. That's what LeVeon Bell just did, and believe it or not, he's better off for it. Putting Bell's decision in a long-term perspective is critical in understanding his rationale, which can be tough considering football is generally a short-term game for most players. At Bell's position, Running Back, most players peak around age 25 and rapidly decline by 28. It's extremely rare to see a running back in the league older than 30, and if there are some they certainly aren't starting. As a running back/receiver combo, Bell was on the field for more than 95% of snaps for the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2017. He touched the ball more times than any other player on the team (except the quarterback), therefore took more hits than any other player, and each year that happens your body becomes less resilient. Bell knew that sitting this season out would signify his desire to leave the Steelers, where he clashed with management, while also forcing their hand into letting him go next year. If Pittsburgh wanted to retain his rights, they'd have to offer him a larger contract than any other running back in the history of the sport, and it's already been made clear they do not value Bell that highly. So, instead of playing one year for a team that he had no desire to get hit for, playing on a contract well below his actual value, Bell decided to push his career timeline back a year. Yes, whatever team he signs with will only get a few seasons out of him with significant production before the running back position grabs another inevitable victim. But now Bell can take those hits for a team guaranteeing him significant money in a long-term contract, instead of for a team that would only sign him a year at a time, and could probably care less if he had gotten hurt. The NFL is a ruthless business, and it's about time the players realized it.
