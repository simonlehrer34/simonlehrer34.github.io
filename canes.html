        <h2>Miami Hurricanes Football</h2>
          <h3>Canes Selected to Pinstripe Bowl</h3>
            <p>The Miami Hurricanes were selected on Sunday to the New Era Pinstripe Bowl, taking place at Yankee Stadium in The Bronx on December 27th. It is Miami's first appearance in the Pinstripe Bowl, and they will match up with fellow first-timer Wisconsin. The two teams played each other in the Orange Bowl last year, with the Badgers edging out the Hurricanes 34 to 24 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. While the Pinstripe Bowl is a significant downgrade from last year's playoff game, the Canes should consider themselves lucky to even be a part of Yankee Stadium's annual bowl game. Miami was able to end the season on a two-game winning streak, but had they lost those games the Canes wouldn't have even qualified for a bowl game. The team begins bowl preparation next week, and they should be sure to pump up the air conditioning in the new Indoor Practice Facility. Expect temperatures in the mid-20s on gameday in New York, which favors cold-weather UW Madison much more than the Miami boys.

          <h3>Something Has to Change: Mark Richt's Next Step in Turning Around The U</h3>
            <p>While there were certain to be some growing pains for redshirt freshman N’Kosi Perry, the team’s mid-season collapse falls on the shoulders of the Head Coach much more than the young Q-B. Mark Richt wasn’t patient enough to sit through Perry’s struggles, and re-opening the quarterback competition halfway through the season was the last thing this offense needed. It made zero sense to throw Malik Rosier back in to the mix as a senior on his way out, especially considering the problem wasn’t the quarterback, it was the playcalling. Perry’s going to run this unit for years, and in-game experience is crucial for a young Q-B’s future success. While the offense improved towards the end of the season, it does still need help – help that I don’t think Coach Richt can offer by himself. Miami’s first order of business should be finding an offensive coordinator, one tailored to N’Kosi Perry’s ability as a dual-threat quarterback. While the offense struggled this season, Manny Diaz established one of the strongest units in the country on the other side of the ball. The defense played a near perfect game in the regular season finale against Pitt, and afterwards, Diaz couldn’t help but rave about their production this season. “This is a unit that should be appreciated for years to come. And at this school, that’s hard. Because there have been some amazing defenses that have come and gone through here…but these guys have put something on tape over a 12 game season that they can be proud of for the rest of their lives.” Diaz should be just as proud himself, considering the role he played in putting this historic defense together. Miami has to cross their fingers and hope that an N-F-L team doesn’t come calling for Manny Diaz, which is unlikely this offseason but realistic – even probable, in the near future. The 20-18 Hurricanes showed occasional flashes of greatness. But their dominant defense was overshadowed by an anemic offensive unit, and that’s just unacceptable for a program of Miami’s caliber. A team with no legitimate receiving threat should not run a pro-style offense, especially when the guy under center is better with his feet than his arm. Mark Richt should do whatever it takes to get the Canes back in the national conversation, and he needs to start by hiring an offensive coordinator as soon as possible.

        <h3>Miami Hurricanes Basketball</h3>
          <p>Canes Off to Slow Start with Rutgers Loss</p>
            <p>The excitement was there in Miami's basketball home opener, but the performance was not. The Hurricanes dropped their first game at the Watsco Center this season by a score of 57-54 against Rutgers. The Scarlet Knights have started their season out strong, with a 5-1 record, but that's no excuse for a program like Miami. The Canes couldn't get anything going in the first half, shooting a woeful 35 percent from the field, and their second half comeback wasn't enough to make up for the slow start. Miami is certainly feeling the loss of their two stars from last year, Bruce Brown Jr. and Lonnie Walker, as they begin their NBA careers this fall with the Detroit Pistons and San Antonio Spurs respectively. While the Hurricanes were expected to regress this year, a loss to Rutgers was not what Coach Larrañaga had in mind to start the season. If Miami wants to even make the NCAA tournament, much less win a game in it, they have to show serious signs of improvement. Fortunately for them, the upcoming schedule is very light, with games against Yale, Houston Baptist, and Campbell before starting conference play. Those three games should be easy victories for the Canes, and they certainly should be considered must-wins as a confidence booster heading into their schedule of ACC powerhouses. Miami's conference slate begins January 6th, at the KFC Yum Center in Louisville.
