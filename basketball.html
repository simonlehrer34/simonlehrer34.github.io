          <h3>Warriors Wounds are Self-Inflicted</h3>
            <p>The 2018-19 Golden State Warriors might be the most talented basketball team ever assembled. Just one month into the season, they've already had three players drop 50 points in a game, a feat that hasn't been accomplished in more than half a century. They will likely send four of their five starters to the All-Star Game (again) and the fifth starter will only miss out because of an injury. This team should not lose a game. Except they have been losing, quite a bit recently. Their four-game slide several weeks back was supposed to be a wake-up call, but the Warriors still look half asleep. Golden State dropped their last two games, even with the re-addition of star point guard Steph Curry. Something is going on here, and it points to the leadership behind the team. Until last year, Curry was the vocal leader among the Warriors while head coach Steve Kerr motivated from the sideline. That hasn't changed, but the presence of Kevin Durant has created an interesting dynamic. While Curry is still a player of world-class talent and a leader on the court, Durant unquestionably has more of an impact on the court. But he isn't vocal, never has been, and relies on teammates to embody leadership. That's perfectly okay – not every talented athlete has to be a talented motivator. But this year, Durant's lack of leadership is being perceived within the team as a lack of motivation. It's easy to rest on your laurels after winning back-to-back championships, especially as Durant considers ditching Golden State this summer to try and alter his complicated legacy. As that decision draws closer, his lack of motivational ability will be perceived more and more as quitting on the team as opposed to just being himself. The other Warrior players need to realize this is who Durant is, and openly voicing a problem with that will only make him more likely to leave in the summer.
