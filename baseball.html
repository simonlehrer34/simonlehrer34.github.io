          <h3>Sox Cap Off Incredible Season With World Series Title</h3>
            <p>7 Months, 120 Wins, and 1 Trophy. What began as a season of unknowns in April ended as a season of triumph on Sunday, as the Boston Red Sox capped off their historic year with a World Series win over the Los Angeles Dodgers, four games to one. Coming off a disappointing 2017, many did not see the Sox contending for a championship under rookie manager Alex Cora. But the University of Miami alum guided Boston to a 108-win regular season, a franchise record, and continued to thrive under the postseason spotlight. His willingness to use starting pitchers as relievers ultimately made up for a weak bullpen, and his creative thinking should not be lost on other managers going forward. First Nathan Eovaldi in Game 4, and Sunday night it was Chris Sale thriving in an untraditional short relief role. Sale fittingly recorded the final out of Boston's record-breaking season.</p>
